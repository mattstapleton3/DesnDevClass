    "This example will scrape information from the github page for the user \"pret.\" pret primarily works on the Pokemon game recreations from scratch that I thought would be interesting to work on. Turns out, github has a variety of little quirks and issues for the Beautiful Soup scraper to work with, which led to me wanting to rip my hair out. At that point, I was far too deep to try anything else, so you'll see some gross looking code that I tried to clean up at the end. \n",

    "\n",
    "The only problematic section here regards the \"information\" project_dict. Previously, it was to be divided between \"Language,\" \"Stargazers,\" and \"Hooks,\" but try as I might these information pieces refused to separate from one another per the way github displays them. Dividing each section further would return a variety of errors that people online didn't want to solve, and seemed directly related to issues with reading data and text in the Beautiful Soup scraper."
